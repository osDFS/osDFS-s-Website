## osDFS's Code of Conduct

# Our Pledge
In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as osDFS applicants, interns, alumni, mentors, coordinators, organizers, and other contributors (collectively known as osDFS community members) pledge to make participation in osDFS and the osDFS community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, caste, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

# Our Standards
Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by osDFS community members include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

osDFS prioritizes marginalized people's safety over privileged people's comfort. The osDFS organizers will not act on complaints regarding:

- "Reverse"-isms, including "reverse racism," "reverse sexism," and "cisphobia"
- The tone or writing style used when responding to harassment, racism, sexism, transphobia, or otherwise oppressive behavior or assumptions
- Reasonable communication of boundaries, such as "leave me alone," "go away," or "I'm not discussing this with you."

# Our Responsibilities

osDFS organizers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

osDFS organizers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct.

osDFS organizers have the right to ban temporarily or permanently any osDFS community member for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful. Examples of bans include but are not limited to:
- A temporary or permanent ban from an osDFS project space
